2017 - Magic
============

The Godess Thriai
-----------------

"The ancient insects dreamed of a goddess; Thriai, who created her photonic hives in the stars and from there her sisters transmit their instructions to the drones below; signal by signal, scent by scent, synapse by synapse. As the photons hit axons, the action potentials travel into the drone minds, the space left behind is hallucinated as hexagrams within hexagons under hives, new hadrons collide and the pattern repeats on the ape-men minions' retinae, they who have ingested their mind control nectars for millennia and harboured the insectoid patterns; dormant and quiescent, until the master glyph sequence of light, sugar, sound reactivates the bee mother's control pattern when fractally projected from machine to man to hive to once again and awakens to the mother Thiai in the stars to signal her to return as stinging aether." - [Ant](https://twitter.com/NoAnthonys)
